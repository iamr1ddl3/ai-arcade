# No automated tests

Nothing in the project has automated tests. Originally this covered only `scrape_trainercentral.py`; the scope has since grown to the whole pipeline: `arcade/generate_content.py` (question generation with invariants worth locking in), `arcade/transform_content.py` (cache keys, verdict parsing, network retry), and `arcade/app.js` (~1,600 lines of game logic: SM-2 scheduling, streak/freeze rules, quest counters, gauntlet state, boss HP, betting XP math).

## Root Cause

Personal single-purpose scraper written to solve an immediate need; correctness validated by running it against real data. The arcade grew the same way — every feature was verified manually in a real browser (documented per-session in [[../log]]), but none of those checks are repeatable.

## Impact

Bumped to **medium** (2026-07-06): the app is heading to a public deploy, and the game-state rules (XP economy, streak freezes, spaced-repetition scheduling) now have enough edge cases that a regression could silently corrupt player progress. The generator's quiz invariants (4 distinct options, answerIndex correctness) are re-checked ad hoc after every build rather than by a test.

## Remediation

Highest-value first, all runnable without network:
1. ✅ **Done (2026-07-15)** — Generator invariants in `arcade/test_generate_content.py` (stdlib `unittest`, no pytest dep to match the generator's stdlib-only rule). Builds a synthetic course tree → runs the generator via subprocess → asserts MCQ/cloze invariants (4 distinct options, answerIndex correctness, blank present), flashcard presence, step order, unique IDs, and determinism. Sabotage-verified (breaking `answerIndex` turns it red). Wired into CI as a `test` job that gates `deploy` (`needs: test`) — a broken generator can no longer reach Cloudflare.
2. ✅ **Done (2026-07-15)** — `transform_content.py` pure parts in `arcade/test_transform_content.py` (19 tests, stdlib `unittest`, imports the module directly since LLM SDKs are lazy-loaded). Covers `cache_key` stability (deterministic; changes with text/id/PROMPT_VERSION → correct re-billing), `parse_verdict` tolerance (plain/fenced/prose JSON, fails-closed on unparseable/invalid/missing keys), `passes` thresholds + string-score tolerance, and the end-to-end "garbage judge output → never ships" path. Also in the CI `test` gate.
3. `app.js` state rules via a thin node harness (`scheduleCard` transitions, `bumpStreak` freeze cases, quest claim-once).
Playwright E2E for the game flows only if regressions actually start appearing.

Severity stays **medium**: the two highest-risk artifacts (the generator CI auto-deploys, and the transform judge/cache gates) are now covered, but the ~1,600-line `app.js` game-state rules (item 3) remain untested.
